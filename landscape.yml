              The z/OS Open Tools github organization serves as a collaborative github organization for z/OS UNIX developers, users, and organizations who contribute to and utilize open-source tools on z/OS.
              z/OS Open Tools started in 2022 with a handful of projects and now currently hosts over 180+ projects, with the aim of providing the build recipes as well as the patches to enable popular open source packages to build and run on z/OS. z/OS Open Tools includes ports for popular open source projects like Git, Bash, Curl, CMake, Make, GPG, LLama.cpp, Vim, Nano and many more.
              z/OS Open Tools also distributes binaries for each of the tools as Github releases. It also provides a z/OS UNIX package manager (zopen) that makes it easy to consume the 180+ tools directly on z/OS.

              The mission of the Project is to curate a dataset of production COBOL and associated mainframe languages (JCL, REXX, PL/I) on which Large Language
              Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned and develop an evaluation suite to measure LLMs' ability to comprehend, explain, and write code in the associated language.

              Create a repository of z/VM tools for use by the z/VM community, collecting the various tools shared via listservs and other locations without a formal home into a single repository. The aim is not to replace other maintained/established repositories but refer to them, though those repositories can join this project if they wish.

              This will provide the community a single location for locating z/VM community tools.
