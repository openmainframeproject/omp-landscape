              The Common REST API (CRA) enables you to retrieve data collected by BMC mainframe monitoring products. Currently, the API works with BMC AMI Ops
              products.


              The BMC Common REST API provides open APIs to retrieve data where those APIs can be used also through the Zowe interface and a user-friendly
              interface to experiment with the REST API calls, known as the Swagger UI.
