# **NOTE: If you are requesting updates to project or member organization information, please follow the instructions in the README.md file.**

### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you including a `repo_url`? You need to pick the single best GitHub repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Does the project meet the guidelines for [new entries](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/omp-landscape#new-entries) section?
* [ ] Have you included a URL for your SVG or added it to `hosted_logos` and referenced it there?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly state the name of the project/product and follow the other logo [guidelines](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/omp-landscape#new-entries)?
* [ ] Does your project name match the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you verified that the Crunchbase data for your organization is correct (including headquarters and LinkedIn)?
* [ ] ~5 minutes after opening the pull request, there will be a link to preview the entry on the staging server. Have you confirmed that it looks good?
